to execute command, we implement different function with respect to simple, sequence, And, or, subshell, pipe command.
1. simple command:
we first deal with the input and output and get the fd.
then, we call fork, do execvp inside child process and call wait inside parent process.
2. and 
first, we call fork and if this child run successfully, we will call another fork inside parent process.
3. or
first, we call fork and if this child run unsuccessfully, we will call another fork inside parent process.
4. sequence
first, we call fork and inside the parent process, we will wait the first child to exit and call another fork.
5. subshell
we first deal with the input and output and get the fd.
then, we call fork, do execute_command (c->u.subshell_command) inside child process and call wait inside parent process.
6.pipe
we first deal with the input and output and get the fd[2].
then, we will fork the get the first child process as the right side of pipe and do execute_command(c->u.command[1]).
then, in the parent process, we will fork one more time the get the second child process as the left side of pipe and do execute_command(c->u.command[0]).
at last, inside the parent process, we let these two child process to wait the other to finish.

* the the whole process, we will set error signal when fd<0, dup2<0, fork fails and waitpid()<0. And we will also record parent’s status from the child’s status.
