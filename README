we implement a build_command_t function to return a command tree to build a complete command stream. in order to check the syntax error, things are arranged as follows:
1.for ;, we will check if ;;/<;/>;/\n; happens. And we will regard ;\n as a ;
2. for other operators like | || &&, we will check if < or > appears right before them.
and if \n appears before them.
3. for ), we will check if it final meets a ) and if < or > appears before it.
4. for < >, we will set the global variables: wait_input and wait_output as a signal. 
And we will also check if </n or >/n happens.
5. for \n, we will check if #operators matches with #commands, if it’s followed by specials other than ( ).
6. when finish building, we will pop all the operators and commands and check it there’s only command left or nothing was pushed ever.
